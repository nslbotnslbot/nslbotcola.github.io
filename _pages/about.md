Hello! I am a Ph.D student at the [Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, the University of Tokyo](https://www.cbms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/). I study and work with [Prof. Martin Frith](https://sites.google.com/site/frithbioinfo/) currently.

Previously, I obtained my Master degree in Science at the University of Tokyo and Bachelor degree in Agronomy at Zhejiang University.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. UI-TEI Kumiko](https://ui-tei.rnai.jp/english-index.html) and [Prof. Martin Frith](https://sites.google.com/site/frithbioinfo/).

You can find my CV ([English](/files/Ni_Shengliang_cv.pdf) and [Chinese](/files/Ni_Shengliang_cv_Chinese.pdf)) here, and my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=oGHnJ3kAAAAJ).

About my research interests
======

I study genomic elements such as repetitive sequences (including transposable elements and simple repeats), pseudogenes, and non-coding RNA and DNA loci across various genomes—including those of eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and specialized cell lines like breast cancer—using bioinformatics and statistical approaches. 
In the future, I aim for my research to be biologically driven at its core, inspiring the development of novel computational tools, which in turn facilitate deeper biological insights—fostering a sustainable, bidirectional advancement between biology and computational methodology.
